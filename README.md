# DBiT-seq-Proteomics Data Processing and Visualization Scripts

This repository hosts the raw data processing and visualization scripts utilized in the DBiT-seq Proteomic Sequencing Project, focused exclusively on the analysis of proteomic data from CITE-seq experiments. It includes core R scripts for tasks such as data visualization, clustering, differential protein expression analysis, spatial pie chart generation, and more.


# Abstract
DBiT-seq-Proteomic is a spatial omics sequencing technique enabling high-plex protein sequencing. In this project, we applied DBiT-seq to human fibrotic lung sections, achieving cellular-level resolution (25Î¼m pixel size). Using a custom panel of 18 ADTs specifically designed for fibrotic lung studies, we uncovered spatial protein expression patterns critical for understanding lung fibrosis.
